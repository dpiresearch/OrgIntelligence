Weekly Sales Forecast - Notes for Week of Oct 21

Rep: Sarah J.
- Innovate Solutions (101): This is a slam dunk. The champion is pushing it internally and they need to go live by Nov 1. Confidence: 95%
- Stellar Corp (104): They are very responsive and seem eager. Good chance this closes Friday. Confidence: 80%
- Data Weavers (105): They've gone cold. I'm leaving it in the forecast for this week but it's a long shot. Might slip. Confidence: 30%

Rep: Mark T.
- Quantum Dynamics (102): Spoke with the VP. They love the proposal. He just needs the final okay from the CFO. Expecting it by EOD Thursday. Confidence: 90%
- Apex Industries (103): Solid deal. Their legal team is quick. We should get the revised contract back and signed this week. Confidence: 85%

- Visionary Tech (107): Great pricing call. They are comparing us with one competitor but said we are the preferred vendor. Strong potential for this week. Confidence: 85%
- Momentum LLC (111): Verbal commit is in. Just a formality at this point. Should sign Wednesday. Confidence: 95%
