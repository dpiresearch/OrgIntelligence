Comment: "Is there a way to collaborate with my team? I'd love to invite them to view and comment on projects directly in the app. Right now I have to export and email everything."

Comment: "Your app would be perfect if it had version history! I accidentally deleted a huge part of my project and there was no way to undo it. So frustrating."
